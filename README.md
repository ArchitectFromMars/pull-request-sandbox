# Pull Request Sandbox
The following sentence was manually typed out on GitHub at the time of creation of this repo.

`A repo to practice doing pull/push requests so I don't break stuff on other projects!`

This next sentence was typed after cloning the repo, and then pushing this .md document back to **GitHub**.

`This is the infamous sentence I was walking about. If you're reading this on gitHub, I succeeded at learning the push command for the gitHub CLI (and it feels darn good, too!)`

`P.S. Are you STILL reading this?? Hire me already!!` üòÅ

Geezus, you're still here? Okay, fine. Watch this comical meme to pass the time.
